# Day 16 Exercise 4 - Generate Then Harden Tests

## Scenario

AI assistants can draft tests quickly, but generated tests may be too broad, brittle or unrealistic.

## Task

Ask an AI assistant to suggest tests for your ticket validation utility. Then manually improve the tests.

## Must include

- At least one required-field test.
- At least one invalid priority or status test.
- At least one payload normalization test.

## Manual hardening checklist

- Use clear test names.
- Avoid testing implementation details.
- Test behaviour, not exact component structure.
- Make locators or assertions specific enough.

## Expected output

Submit the final tests and a short note explaining what you improved from the AI draft.
